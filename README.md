Bulletin
========

A simple web page in which any user can post messages for the world to see.

The front end is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using JQuery. The backend is a node.js server communicating with a MySQL database, which stores user messages.

I wrote this as an exercise in the basics of web development. It's helped me learn how websites work on both ends and given me experience working with databases.



Future plans:
  * Import a CSS framework (probably Bootstrap) to improve the page's look
  * Deploy on an AWS server and link to it on [mattrichard.me](www.mattrichard.me).
