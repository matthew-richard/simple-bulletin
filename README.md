Simple Bulletin
========

A simple web page in which any user can post messages for the world to see.

The front end is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using jQuery. The backend is a node.js server communicating with a MySQL database, which stores user messages.

I wrote this as an exercise in the basics of web development. It's helped me learn how websites work on both ends and given me experience working with databases.

To start the server, run `node server.js`. To access the bulletin, visit `localhost:8080` in your browser.

Future plans:
  * Import a CSS framework (probably Bootstrap) to improve the page's look
  * Deploy on an AWS server and link to it on [mattrichard.me](http://www.mattrichard.me).
